bradify
=======

Create a Brady Number-like sequence for any pair of numbers and observe their
ratios tending towards phi

Also includes a small library for quickly handling Lucas sequences.

This was written in Python 3 and is entirely untested on Python 2 (it should
work fine with some very minor tweaking, though).

If you want to explore Lucas sequences, I would recommend opening an interactive
python3 shell and importing lucas from there. You can also write scripts based
on lucas. bradify.py is an example script of this sort.
